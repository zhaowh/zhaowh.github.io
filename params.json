A meme acts as a unit for carrying cultural ideas, symbols, or practices that can be transmitted from one mind to another through writing, speech, gestures, rituals, or other imitable phenomena with a mimicked theme. Supporters of the concept regard memes as cultural analogues to genes in that they self-replicate, mutate, and respond to selective pressures.[[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme)]\r\n\r\n### What's mismeme?\r\nA wrong, mistaken, harmful meme.\r\n",
